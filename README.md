# OpenInSAR
A placeholder for future development of an open toolbox for maximising the value from Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometric analysis. OpenInSAR aims to be a resource researchers and engineers everywhere to leverage state-of-the-art techniques in a cross-platform, scalable, and modular software environment.

OpenInSAR has applied for development funding which would begin in April 2021, but until then this repository will steadily be updated with new tools.

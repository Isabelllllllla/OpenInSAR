# OpenInSAR
A placeholder for future development of an open toolbox for maximising the value from Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometric analysis. OpenInSAR aims to be a resource researchers and engineers everywhere to leverage state-of-the-art techniques in a cross-platform, scalable, and modular software environment.

OpenInSAR has applied for development funding which we hope can facilitate full-time development in April 2021, but until then this repository may be steadily updated with new tools.
